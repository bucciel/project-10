Elise Bucciarelli, Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 10: Full Stack App with React and a REST API

This project uses React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (project 9). This application will allow users to view a full list of courses, the details for a specific course. They will also be able to create an account or sign in with an existing account, and create, update, or delete courses that they own.

This project has been styled with a Harry Potter theme, in order to maintain the themed courses and users please refrain from running `npm run seed`.

- Harry Potter | email: `harry@potter.com` | password: `harrypassword`
- Hermione Granger | email: `hermione@granger.com` | password: `hemionepassword`
- Ron Weasley | email: `ron@weasley.com` | password: `ronpassword`

Original user information if `npm run seed` is used:
