Elise Bucciarelli, Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 10: Full Stack App with React and a REST API

_____________________
This project uses React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (project 9). This application will allow users to view a full list of courses, the details for a specific course. They will also be able to create an account or sign in with an existing account, and create, update, or delete courses that they own.
